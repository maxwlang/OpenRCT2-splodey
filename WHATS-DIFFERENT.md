# What is this fork?
This fork adds various tweaks and changes to OpenRCT2 that my friends and I found to be funny or quality of life improvements. This fork started after attempts to use the plugin API didn't yield fully satisfactory results.

## Will you merge it into OpenRCT2?
Probably not. I can't imagine they'd want this, but we'll probably track the origin repository for a while.

## What changed?

+ Added "Allow incomplete rides" cheat option under Ride Cheats. When enabled, rides may be opened in an incomplete state.
+ Added "Normalise ride crashes" under Ride Cheats. When enabled rides that crash will not close, empty queue paths, or be docked in any negative way.
